# üåê Web Intelligence Workflow (n8n)

This n8n workflow automatically gathers information from the internet to answer a user's query using powerful LLMs and content extraction. It integrates multiple services to perform intelligent web search, content parsing, and summarization.

## üß† Workflow Overview

1. **User Input**  
   A question or topic is provided as input via the `Edit Fields` node.

2. **Search the Web**  
   The query is passed to the Serper API to get Google search results (top 7 links).

3. **Scrape Web Content**  
   The URLs are passed to Scrappey API to fetch raw HTML content.

4. **Extract Main Article Text**  
   Langchain Information Extractor removes irrelevant HTML elements (ads, navigation, etc.) and retrieves only the main article content.

5. **Chunk and Merge Content**  
   The extracted content is:
   - Chunked into smaller parts for LLM processing
   - Passed through a Groq LLM to summarize or clean each chunk
   - Merged back into a single text block

6. **Final Answer Generation**  
   The merged content is sent to an LLM Agent (Groq) which answers the original question using the processed information.
